<img src="./cover.png" width="33%" alt="Front cover" align="right"/>

An open access book on scientific visualization using python and matplotlib to
be released during summer 2020 (hopefully). Sources will be available in this
repository, the PDF book will be open-access and the printed book will cost 50$.

If you want to support the book, you can you can [tip a few
euros](https://www.paypal.me/NicolasPRougier/10). If you want to have access to
the private repository during the writing, you can [tip a few more
euros](https://www.paypal.me/NicolasPRougier/25) (and let me know abour your
github handle). If you're a company, you can also [sponsor

repository will be made public at the end of the writing and the PDF will be
available for free.
